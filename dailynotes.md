 Today I learned about three types of encryption, and what and ACL is. The three typed of encryption include symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid.  Symmetric encryption is less complex and less secure. It used when speed is the priority. Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption because different keys are used for the encryption and decryption processes. Its a slower process than symmetric encryption.  

An ACL is made of a list of permissions: it tells which users have access to which resources and which operations they are allowed. For example, a company might decide to define permissions based on job role. When someone new is hired, they automatically receive all the permissions that come with the role by being placed into the appropriate role group.

Victor reintroduced us to the Boolean method for job searching. He showed us how to search for jobs  and told us to use  LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Dice as well as a recruiter. The more job searching resources we use, the better chances we have in obtaining a job. For example, a company might decide to define permissions based on job role. When someone new is hired, they automatically receive all the permissions that come with the role by being placed into the appropriate role group.
