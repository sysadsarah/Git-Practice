**Week of March 27th Notes**
I listened a the darknet diaries podcast called Jason’s, Pen test. Jason 
talked about doing pen tests back in the days when he had to physically 
break into companies server room and limited access spaces. He mentioned 
using a blow up doll on one of his missions. He lied on the ground to blow up the 
doll until sensor activated. I added a commit to Gitlab. I created a branch on one 
of my repositories on Github and made some additions there.
I started the Python Module

**Python Module

I learned that GoLang is a language that google created. 
Primitive date type is data that are built into a coding language with no modification.
Composite data type combines multiple data types into a single unit.
Programming is a way to automate processes. Programming languages specify a way to communicate 
directions to a computer. Software is written into a text file by using a programming language, 
which is either interpreted or compiled when it is run. Data is typed so that the interpreter or 
compiler knows whether it is a string, integer, Boolean, or other data type.
A composite data type stores different types of data in a single variable.
Functions are collections of instructions that can be called repeatedly in a program.
Version control manages changes to computer programs, documents, or other collections of information.

Today my group presented on the topic of Malware and AWS services 
to keep the cloud safe. We watched presentations by our classmates 
and learned a  bit. A topic that stood out to me during the presentations 
was pen testing. A penetration tester is responsible for finding security 
vulnerabilities, including determining which penetration testing method 
(Gupta, 2021) is best suited to the situation. This is a challenging task 
that requires advanced skills and knowledge. A penetration tester needs 
to be familiar with different hacking techniques and have in-depth network 
security knowledge. They must also know how to use various tools to assess 
the target system’s security posture.

There are five penetration testing phases: reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and reporting.Pen testers use tools to examine the target website or system for weaknesses, 
including open services, application security issues, and open source vulnerabilities.

What I learned: 
I  was looking at the last part of the security module and wanted to 
revisit the information about the AWS Trusted Advisor. Questions about this 
service keeps popping up on the Cloud Practitioner practice tests so I want to 
make sure I know what it is.
Trusted Advisor is an online resource to help you reduce cost, increase 
performance, and improve security by optimizing your AWS environment. 
It provides best practices (or checks) in five categories:
1. Cost Optimization – Save money on AWS by reducing unused and 
idle resources or making commitments to reserved capacity.
2. Performance – Improve the performance of your service by checking 
your service limits, ensuring that you take advantage of provisioned throughput, 
and monitoring for over-utilized instances.
3. Security – Improve the security of your application by closing gaps, 
activating various AWS security features, and examining your permissions.
4. Fault Tolerance – Increase the availability and redundancy of your AWS 
application by taking advantage of automatic scaling, health checks, multiple 
Availability Zones, and backup capabilities.
5. Service Limits – Check for service usage that is more than 80 percent of the service limit.
The status of the check is shown 
 
March 21st Notes Continued.
From the Test prep 
Amazon Aurora is a relational database management system (RDBMS) built for the cloud with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility. Aurora gives you the performance and availability of commercial-grade databases at one-tenth the cost.
Amazon Aurora: enterprise class - works with mysql - 5x faster -automatic. 
Its best to have multiple AWS account.  Its part of the AWS best practice to do so. 
Spot instances get 90 percent discount! 
Your DNS is the service that translates your domain name into an IP address. AWS Route 53 is a smart DNS system that can dynamically change your origin address based on load, and even perform load balancing before traffic even reaches your servers.


Today we decided to choose Malware as our topic for the presentation on Friday. At the moment, the class is watching an AWS Cloud Practitioner test prep, in the Zoom lobby, thanks to Afnan. Simultaneously, I am doing some research for the  presentation and editing some slides.

## H2 Mortal Kombat Malware


From the security module, I learned about malware and Intrusion detection system. 
Malicious software (malware) is designed to cause harm to a computer system 
by interrupting one of the CIA triad elements: – Confidentiality – Integrity – Availability
Malware include: – Worms – Bots – Ransomware – Viruses

They get you by getting your information on a fake or insecure website, emails or 
removable devices, web links and more. 
Some antivirus programs include:• AVG • McAfee • Norton • Kaspersky. Use these to 
keep your computer safe. 

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a hardware or software solution that monitors a 
network or a computer system to detect intrusions or malicious activity. When this kind 
of activity happens, the IDS generates alerts to notify security personnel.
An IDS can detect an attack by using different mechanisms, including the following:
• Anomaly-based detection – The IDS compares the current traffic pattern or system 
activity against established baselines for any deviation. • Signature-based detection – The IDS monitors and analyzes the traffic for known patterns 
of attack.

Today I learned about three types of encryption, and what and ACL is. The three typed of encryption include symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid.  Symmetric encryption is less complex and less secure. It used when speed is the priority. Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption because different keys are used for the encryption and decryption processes. Its a slower process than symmetric encryption.  

An ACL is made of a list of permissions: it tells which users have access to which resources and which operations they are allowed. For example, a company might decide to define permissions based on job role. When someone new is hired, they automatically receive all the permissions that come with the role by being placed into the appropriate role group.

Victor reintroduced us to the Boolean method for job searching. He showed us how to search for jobs  and told us to use  LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Dice as well as a recruiter. The more job searching resources we use, the better chances we have in obtaining a job. For example, a company might decide to define permissions based on job role. When someone new is hired, they automatically receive all the permissions that come with the role by being placed into the appropriate role group.
