Today we decided to choose Malware as our topic for the presentation on Friday. At the moment, theclass is watching an AWS Cloud Practitioner test prep, in the Zoom lobby, thanks to Afnan. Simultaneously, I am doing some research for the  presentation and editing some slides.

## H2 Mortal Kombat Malware


From the security module, I learned about malware and Intrusion detection system. 
Malicious software (malware) is designed to cause harm to a computer system 
by interrupting one of the CIA triad elements: – Confidentiality – Integrity – Availability
Malware include: – Worms – Bots – Ransomware – Viruses

They get you by getting your information on a fake or insecure website, emails or 
removable devices, web links and more. 
Some antivirus programs include:• AVG • McAfee • Norton • Kaspersky. Use these to 
keep your computer safe. 

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a hardware or software solution that monitors a 
network or a computer system to detect intrusions or malicious activity. When this kind 
of activity happens, the IDS generates alerts to notify security personnel.
An IDS can detect an attack by using different mechanisms, including the following:
• Anomaly-based detection – The IDS compares the current traffic pattern or system 
activity against established baselines for any deviation. • Signature-based detection – The IDS monitors and analyzes the traffic for known patterns 
of attack.

Today I learned about three types of encryption, and what and ACL is. The three typed of encryption include symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid.  Symmetric encryption is less complex and less secure. It used when speed is the priority. Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption because different keys are used for the encryption and decryption processes. Its a slower process than symmetric encryption.  

An ACL is made of a list of permissions: it tells which users have access to which resources and which operations they are allowed. For example, a company might decide to define permissions based on job role. When someone new is hired, they automatically receive all the permissions that come with the role by being placed into the appropriate role group.

Victor reintroduced us to the Boolean method for job searching. He showed us how to search for jobs  and told us to use  LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Dice as well as a recruiter. The more job searching resources we use, the better chances we have in obtaining a job. For example, a company might decide to define permissions based on job role. When someone new is hired, they automatically receive all the permissions that come with the role by being placed into the appropriate role group.
